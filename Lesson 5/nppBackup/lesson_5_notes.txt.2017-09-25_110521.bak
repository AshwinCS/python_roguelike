How are we going to structure our objects in the game?


We could structure the objects in our game as a strict inheritance system:

Parents--->Children
A top-down style method.
All children inherit the code from the parents.

Example: Actor (parent) --> Item (child) - Characters (Child) -- Containers (Child)
Then these children parent their own children:
Actor --> Item --> Potions -- Scrolls -- Weapons
Actor --> Characters --> Player -- Enemies 
etc.


vs.


An inheritance system can quickly turn into a hot-mess.

Or we could choose a "component system"
We 'glue on' parts of 
Component System--> more like a Ecosystem
In a compontent system we 'glue on' components to different classes. A more bottom up method.

There is no parent - child relationship.

Objects do not inherit code from their parents. There are no parents.

example: Player = Actor()
we pass lot's of different components to Player.

Enemy gets passed "AI" component, "Creature component" etc.

Remember: We are calling an "Actor" anything that interacts with the game.
