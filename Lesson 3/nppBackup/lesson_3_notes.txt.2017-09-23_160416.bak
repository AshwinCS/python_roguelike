C has a Struct - a class with no methods - only variables.

Python we are going to use Structs (Structures) to build our map.

Ways to build a Map:

1.) A physics based map - like a AAA game.
	--Actually create objects that have physics attached to them
	--Map is an object that has its own physics
	--Things like
	
2.) Address based system
	--What we are going to use
	--A map you can read like an atlas
	--Map is an array with information on what is on the map where.

Tile Struct:
	--Where we store information about the tiles.
