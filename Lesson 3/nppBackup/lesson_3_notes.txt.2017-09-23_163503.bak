C has a Struct - a class with no methods - only variables.

Python we are going to use Structs (Structures) to build our map.

Ways to build a Map:

1.) A physics based map - like a AAA game.
	--Actually create objects that have physics attached to them
	--Map is an object that has its own physics
	--Things like
	
2.) Address based system
	--What we are going to use
	--A map you can read like an atlas
	--Map is an array with information on what is on the map where.

Tile Struct:
	--Where we store information about the tiles.
	--Example: We could have Boolean values that store
			--is this a block or path? True / False
			--Is this tile visible? True / False
	--Example: We could have a different kind of variable (like a tuple) of what the tile is:
		--Sand? Dirt? Marble? etc.

Map is going to be coordinates of "tile structures" (tile objects) each tile is going to have their own variables.


This lesson tile is only going to have 1 variable. A boolean. Is the tile walkable or not.

Map is a 2d Array(list of lists) [30][30] filled with instances of class struc_Tile.
